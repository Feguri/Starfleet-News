                <b>Deep Space Nine</b> - BREAKING - Deep Space 9 is invaded by Cardassians with the help of
                 the dominion. Shortly after joining their empire, the dominion started sending Jem'hadar
                  ships through the wormhole. A military raid was suspected, so the engineers of the station
                   came up with a plan to close the wormhole. However, it was too late. The Jem`hadar fleet
                    combined with the Cardassian military have raided and taken control of the station, which
                     is key to conquering the Alpha Quadrant.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were multiple reasons why this attack happened. The Cardassians wanted to retake the station
                 due to its proximity to Bajor, formerly colonized by them. The Station, initially built to guard
                  and dominate the people of Bajor by the Cardassians themselves, is key for a new Cardassian
                   dictatorship over the Bajorans. However, Bajor has signed a peace treaty with the Dominion,
                    and since Cardassia is now part of the dominion, it halts their plans of domination (for the moment).

            <p>
                The Dominion is very interested in Deep Space Nine`s proximity to the wormhole,
                 which connects both the Alpha Quadrant and the Delta Quadrant of the galaxy. 
                 If they get hold of it, it will be game over for the Federation. They will be 
                 able to send their massive army and attack the Federation, eventually winning 
                 the war. But all hopes aren’t lost just yet, the team of brilliant DS9 engineers
                  came up with a plan to cover up the wormhole, at least for a few days.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thousands of mines surround the wormhole. But you’d think “well then why don’t they detonate them all?”
                 - that’s when the trick comes in. Every time a mine goes off, it sends a message to a neighbouring mine
                  to replicate itself, rendering the total number of mines the same, which essentially creates an invisible
                   barrier. It is crucial that the Federation takes back control of Deep Space Nine, or dark times will come ...
