                <b>Deep Space Nine</b> - A tragic event took the lives of 31 young Red Squad cadets in dominion space.
                 I was myself involved in the event, which was fueled by their delusional captain that attempted
                  a suicide mission. Their mission was to take down a massive Galaxy Class Dominion starship with
                   a risky plan that was bound to fail. The crewmembers, some as young as 17, were so devoted to 
                   complete their mission and defend the honor of Starfleet’s Red Squad that I was locked up in the
                    brig after attempting to convince them that their mission would fail horribly.
            </p>
            <p>
                After spending a few days with the crew it became increasingly apparent that their captain was
                 manipulative and dictatorial. No crewmember was allowed to remember home, or even speak of it
                  for that matter. Their intrapersonal relationships were limited only to the dominion war and
                   a blind devotion to Starfleet and honor. The captain’s manipulation was so effective that my
                    Ferenghi friend, Nog, was lured to accept a chief engineering role that was key to the
                     planning of the mission. Nog helped them increase the warp drive’s capabilities which 
                     allowed them to get to the dominion ship.

                A flaw in the dominion ship’s antimatter system was found, which led them to believe that they
                 could destroy the ship by exposing the system to Delta radiation. The only problem was that,
                  to accomplish the mission, the ship would have to get dangerously close to the galaxy-class 
                  starship. That meant immediate death, of course.Valiant was no match to the dominion ship. 
                  But the red squad believed they could do it, and that’s all that mattered. After the mission 
                  failed horribly, I was able to escape with Nog and a Red Squad crewmember, who was still 
                  delusionally devoted to their honor...
